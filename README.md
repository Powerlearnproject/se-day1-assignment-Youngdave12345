#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is the systematic application engineering principle, method and tools to development and maintenbce of high quality software system
Importance: It play a crucial role in technology industries by enabling the creation of application and system that power various aspect of mordern life including communication, commerce,entertsinment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
   In the 1960s, software development faced challenges due to the increasing complexity of programs. Structured programming emerged as a paradigm that emphasized breaking down programs into smaller, manageable blocks or modules, each with a single entry and exit point. This approach reduced the complexity of code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
   
   2) Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s)
    Object-oriented programming introduced the concept of "objects"â€”encapsulated data and behavior that can interact with each other. OOP emphasizes principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, allowing for the creation of more modular, reusable, and scalable code.

3) Rise of Agile Methodologies (Late 1990s-2000s)
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emerged as a response to the rigidity of traditional software development approaches like the Waterfall model. Agile promotes iterative development, collaboration between cross-functional teams, and flexibility in responding to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Requirement : Gathering and documenting users needs and system requirement
ii) Design : Creating highlevel and detailed design of the software  architecture and user interface
iii) Implementation : writing code and building software according to the desigining requirement
 iv) Testing : COnducting diffrent test to see that the software meet standards and functional requirement
v) Deployment : Releasing the software to user or customer
iiv) Maintenance : Providing outgoing support,update and enhancement to the software after deploment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Sequntial approach with distinct phase flowing downward like a river e.g ( requirement, design and implemetation).
Agile : iterative and incremental approach  focused on flexibility, colaboration and responding to changes


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer: 
Role: Designs, codes, and implements software solutions.
Responsibilities: Writing and testing code, debugging, implementing features, and collaborating with other developers and team members to meet project goals.

Quality Assurance Engineer: 
Role: Ensures the quality and functionality of software.
Responsibilities: Designing and executing tests, identifying bugs, ensuring software meets requirements, and verifying that issues are resolved before release.

Project Manager:
Role: Oversees the project from initiation to completion.
Responsibilities: Planning, scheduling, coordinating tasks, managing resources, ensuring project stays on track, and communicating with stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance if IDEs: 
Streamlines Development: IDEs provide tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one place, making coding more efficient.
Boosts Productivity: Features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection help developers write and debug code faster.
Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.

VCS:
Tracks Changes: VCS allows developers to track and manage changes to code, making it easier to revert to previous versions if needed.
Enables Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing:
Focus: Tests individual components or functions.
Importance: Ensures each part works correctly in isolation, catching bugs early.

Integration Testing:
Focus: Tests how components work together.
Importance: Identifies issues in interactions between modules, ensuring smooth integration.

System Testing:
Focus: Tests the complete system as a whole.
Importance: Verifies that the entire application meets requirements and works as expected.

Acceptance Testing:
Focus: Validates the system against user requirements.
Importance: Ensures the software meets business needs and is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Definition: The process of designing and refining input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant outputs.
Importance: Helps users get precise, useful responses from AI by framing queries effectively, improving AI interaction and output quality.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:

"Tell me about history."
Improved Prompt:

"Explain the causes and effects of the French Revolution in the late 18th century."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

Specificity: Focuses on a particular historical event.
Clarity: Defines the exact information needed (causes and effects).
Conciseness: Removes ambiguity, making it easier for the AI to provide a relevant and accurate response.
